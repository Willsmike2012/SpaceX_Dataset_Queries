SpaceX is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. It advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars whereas other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.
